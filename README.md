### CS 2510 Accelerated

This repository represents the work that is done in Northeastern University's Spring 2018 CS 2510 Accelerated course. This work is split into three sections:

---

**hw**

*hw-1*: The basics of classes

-  ```Painting.java``` - A simple painting class to represent information about a painting
-  ```WinterOutfit.java``` - Using interfaces to represent unions, this class represents the winter outfit as a ```BaseLayer``` with layers of ```Covering```. 
-  ```ExamplesGame.java``` - The beginnings of a game, with ```IResource``` to represent resources and ```IAction``` to represent actions the player can take.
-  ```BouncingBalls.java``` - A simulation of bouncing balls. 

---

**labs**

*lab-1*: Setup for Eclipse, and beginning to work with classes. 

- ```Shapes.java``` - sample file handed out to experiment with classes and interfaces. 

---

**notes**

*lecture-1*: The basics of Java, such as primitives, class constructors, and methods.

*lecture-2*: Using Interfaces to represent union data

*lecture-3*: Incorporating methods in Interfaces

*lecture-4*: Implementing lists using ConsLo and MtLo.

*lecture-5*: Using Accumulators in an Ancestor Tree.
